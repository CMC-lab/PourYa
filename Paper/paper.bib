  abstract = {Perceptual multistability has been studied for centuries using a diverse collection of approaches. Insights derived from this phenomenon range from core principles of information processing, such as perceptual inference, to high-level concerns, such as visual awareness. The dominant computational explanations of perceptual multistability are based on the Helmholtzian view of perception as inverse inference. However, these approaches struggle to account for the crucial role played by value, e.g., with percepts paired with reward dominating for longer periods than unpaired ones. In this study, we formulate perceptual multistability in terms of dynamic, value-based, choice, employing the formalism of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We use binocular rivalry as an example, considering different explicit and implicit sources of reward (and punishment) for each percept. The resulting values are time-dependent and influenced by novelty as a form of exploration. The solution of the POMDP is the optimal perceptual policy, and we show that this can replicate and explain several characteristics of binocular rivalry, ranging from classic hallmarks such as apparently spontaneous random switches with approximately gamma-distributed dominance periods to more subtle aspects such as the rich temporal dynamics of perceptual switching rates. Overall, our decision-theoretic perspective on perceptual multistability not only accounts for a wealth of unexplained data, but also opens up modern conceptions of internal reinforcement learning in service of understanding perceptual phenomena, and sensory processing more generally. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Substantial experimental, theoretical, and computational insights into sensory processing have been derived from the phenomena of perceptual multistability---when two or more percepts alternate or switch in response to a single sensory input. Here, we review a range of findings suggesting that alternations can be seen as internal choices by the brain responding to values. We discuss how elements of external, experimenter-controlled values and internal, uncertainty- and aesthetics-dependent values influence multistability. We then consider the implications for the involvement in switching of regions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, which are more conventionally tied to value-dependent operations such as cognitive control and foraging.},

  abstract = {Network theory of mental illness posits that causal interactions between symptoms give rise to mental health disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that depression network connectivity may be a risk factor for transitioning and sustaining a depressive state. Here we analysed social media (Twitter) data from 946 participants who retrospectively self-reported the dates of any depressive episodes in the past 12 months and current depressive symptom severity. We construct personalised, within-subject, networks based on depression-related linguistic features. We show an association existed between current depression severity and 8 out of 9 text features examined. Individuals with greater depression severity had higher overall network connectivity between depression-relevant linguistic features than those with lesser severity. We observed within-subject changes in overall network connectivity associated with the dates of a self-reported depressive episode. The connectivity within personalized networks of depression-associated linguistic features may change dynamically with changes in current depression symptoms.},
